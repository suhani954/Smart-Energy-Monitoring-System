SMART ENERGY MONITORING SYSTEM
An AI-powered Smart Energy Monitoring and Advisory Platform for real-time performance tracking and optimization.

Overview
Smart Energy Monitoring System is a full-stack energy monitoring and analytics system that collects real-time system metrics and power usage data through an intelligent local agent 
and Browser Metrics. It visualizes energy consumption patterns, predicts inefficiencies, and provides actionable insights to improve energy efficiency and resource utilization.

Key Features
1. Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks CPU, memory, power usage, and running processes in real time.
2. High-Frequency Data Collection: Handles 10,000+ records/day through optimized FastAPI endpoints.
3. Dynamic Dashboards: React.js interface for live visualization with 40% faster data refresh.
4. AI-Powered Insights: Predictive analysis for smarter energy-saving recommendations (up to 25% efficiency improvement).
5. Local Agent Integration: Lightweight Python agent that continuously sends system data to the backend.
6. Scalable Architecture: Built for modularity, maintainability, and future IoT integration.
7. Robust API Design: Secure REST API endpoints with FastAPI for high-speed data handling.
